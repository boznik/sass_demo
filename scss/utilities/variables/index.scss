// Variables
//
// Variables are a way to store information that will be reused throughout a
// project. They store things like colors and fonts, or any CSS value that'll be
// reused.
// Every variable is declared as !default so that it can be
// overridden by a previous import.
// If you want to override a variable, set that variable in one of your
// own partials, then @import '{path/to/}core/variables'.
//

@import
  'core/index',
  'box-shadow/index',
  'modular-scale/index';
